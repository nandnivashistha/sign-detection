The Sign Detection project is an AI-powered system that recognizes and interprets hand signs using computer vision and machine learning. This project is designed to assist in real-time sign recognition for various applications, including accessibility solutions, gesture-based control, and interactive systems.

📊 Dataset
The model is trained on a custom dataset of hand signs. You can enhance its performance by adding more labeled images to the dataset.

How It Works-
1. Capture hand gestures using a webcam
2. Process images with OpenCV & preprocess for the model
3.  Predict the sign using a trained deep learning model
4.  Display the recognized sign on the screen
