The Sign Detection project is an AI-powered system that recognizes and interprets hand signs using computer vision and machine learning. This project is designed to assist in real-time sign recognition for various applications, including accessibility solutions, gesture-based control, and interactive systems.

📊 Dataset
The model is trained on a custom dataset of hand signs. You can enhance its performance by adding more labeled images to the dataset.

🚀 How It Works
1️⃣ Capture hand gestures using a webcam
2️⃣ Process images with OpenCV & preprocess for the model
3️⃣ Predict the sign using a trained deep learning model
4️⃣ Display the recognized sign on the screen
